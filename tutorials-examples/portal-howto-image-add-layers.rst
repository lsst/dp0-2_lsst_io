.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _Tutorials-Examples-DP0-2-Portal-howto-image-add-layers:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

**Introduction:**
This tutorial demonstrates how to add layers to the active images retreived from a basic Portal query for image data.

**1. Execute an Image query.** 
Go to `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud>`_ , select the Portal Aspect, and
click on the "DP0.2 Images" tab at the top. Enter your desired constraints for the image query,
and click "Search" to execute it.

**2. Explore available image layer options.**
Click the Tools icon (A in Figure 1) to open the drop-down menu,
then mouse-over each icon in the "Layers" section (red circle in Figure 1) to see pop-up description boxes.

**3. Add a compass.** 
Click the north-east arrow icon (C in Figure 1). The compass will appear on the image.
Change its color to purple by clicking the Overlay icon (B in Figure 1),
then clicking "Color" to the right of "North Arrow", and selecting purple.

**4. Add a coordinate grid.**
Click the Grid icon (D in Figure 1) to display the coordinate grid on the image.  
Change its coordinate system to the Galactic coordinate by clicking the Overlay icon
and selecting "Galactic" from the drop-down menu under "Grid". 

**5. Add a ruler to measure distance.**
Click the Ruler icon (E in Figure 1), click a starting point on the image, and drag to an endpoint.
Click the Overlay icon, check "Offset Calculation" under "Distance Tool", and set "Unit" to degrees.

**6. Add a mask.**
Click the Mask icon (F in Figure 1), enter "2" under "HDU Index" to use the 2nd extension of the active image file, and click OK.  
Alternatively, uploading a custom mask file is possible.  

**7. Add a marker.**
Click the last icon (G in Figure 1) and select "Add Marker" to place a marker at the center.  
Click and drag it to the lower-left corner, resize it by dragging any corner, and set its label to "object of interest".  
Change the label location to "NE" from the "Corner" drop-down menu.

**8. Add a footprint.**
Click the last icon (G in Figure 1) and select "NIRCAM" from "Add JWST footprint". 
The footprint will appear in the center of the image. Move it by clicking and dragging any part of it. 
To rotate, click the Overlay icon and enter "45" for "Angle" under "Footprint: JWST NIRCAM",
or drag the rotate handle by 45 degrees.

**9. Remove a layer.**
To temporalily remove a layer, click the Overlay icon and toggle the sliding button next to the layer.
To completely remove a layer, click the "X" next to its "Color" box.
