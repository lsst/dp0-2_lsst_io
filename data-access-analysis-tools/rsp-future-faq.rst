Q: Will there be batch resources available to users?
A: Yes. The RSP will provide a shared computing cluster for users to perform analysis through its Portal, Notebook, and Web API Aspects. The cluster will be managed by a workload management system based on predetermined policies to allocate resources to individual users or groups. LSST users will have an initial allocation of batch CPU time, with the possibility of applying for additional quota through a Resource Allocation Committee. The size of the batch computing resource is determined by the requirement to provide 10% of the total LSST computing and storage resources to users. Users can launch jobs primarily through the APIs exposed in Notebook and Web API Aspects, and the Portal may potentially use the batch computing cluster too.
