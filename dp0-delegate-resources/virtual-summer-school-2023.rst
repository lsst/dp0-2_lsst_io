.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-VSS2023:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

Overview
========

In preparation for the start of Rubin Observatory Operations, simulated datasets and analysis tools have been developed for Rubin data-rights holders in the Rubin community. The Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2), which was released on June 30 2022, provides simulated Legacy Survey for Space and Time(LSST)-like images generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) that can be accessed and analyzed by the web-based Rubin Science Platform (RSP). The goal of this DP0.2 Virtual Summer School is to introduce any data-right holding scientist (from undergraduate student to tenured faculty/staff) to the DP0.2 dataset and the RSP and to provide an accelerated learning experience enabling research on the DP0.2 dataset and future data previews/releases. In order to develop a thriving Rubin science community, another key goal of the Virtual Summer School is to provide opportunites for networking, collaboration, and new-skill acquisition for participants. The Virtual Summer School will span 5 days between June 12 - 16, where each day will be split into two ~2-3 hr sessions to accommodate the international time-zones of the participants. Each day will cover key utilities of the RSP (e.g. Catalogs, Images, Butler) with guided tutorials by members of the Rubin Community Engagement Team, and there will be dedicated time for collaborative discussions and hack sessions. The primary meeting platform will be Zoom, and we aim to providing recordings of each session prior to the beginning of the following session so that participants are able to follow the full meeting. A VSS2023 Slack Workspace will also be created to encourage both synchronous and asynchronous discussions.
